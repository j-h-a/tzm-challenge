TZM advocacy direction 2014 - should it change?
-----------------------------------------------

In the spirit of the TZM Challenge, I will highlight some problems with the
current direction of TZM advocacy in order that TZM can alter their initiatives
and have greater impact in achieving global sustainability for humanity.

In summary:

1. The approach used by TZM is not scientific.
2. The arguments against pricing fail to recognise its social and democratic
potential.
3. It is invalid to dismiss transition issues as "peripheral".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



1. An un-scientific approach
----------------------------

While TZM advocates a scientific approach to governing society based on natural
laws, it is proposing a single solution which requires global uptake. This
makes it untestable except by actually doing it. Empirical data to support
their claim that an NLRBE is the best way to achieve global sustainability
cannot be gathered in advance. The analysis put forward is speculation based on
evidence from experts in various fields about how things might work in an
NLRBE, and while there is some weight to this, its certitude is
disproportionate to the risk involved in trying it. In addition to this,
NLRBE is often justified with circular reasoning and is therefore
unfalsifiable. For example: There would be no reason for people to behave like
that in an RBE; The education system in an RBE would ensure that isn’t a
problem. This adhesion to a single, untestable, unfalsifiable solution with the
unverified assumption that it is correct is unscientific.

Reverse the idea "We need an NLRBE in order to ensure sustainable access
abundance." to get "Once we have sustainable access abundance, we will be
living in an NLRBE.". This opens up many possible implementations and paths
that achieve the goal of sustainable access abundance. In all likelihood these
solutions would have many similarities with the NLRBE currently put forward by
TZM, but this approach allows scientific investigation of these ideas. They can
be made testable, experimented with, falsified, refined, simulated, and
eventually validated through real world trials.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



2. Money and pricing
--------------------

The arguments against money and pricing are based on their use and effects
within the current global market, which is a closed, dishonest, and
profit-driven economy. They are valid in that context, but don’t consider how
useful money and pricing could be in any alternative systems that turn price
into a rational measure of subjective demand preferences balanced against
availability (determined by the design efficiency equation).

If a new type of monetary system were set up correctly, money could be used as
a mechanism for obtaining public consensus about a wide range of issues (not
just what to produce). Not a consensus of pure wants, a consensus balanced
and constrained by social cost (in terms of resources including energy). This
would be the rawest form of a participatory direct democracy. Unless the public
have a view of (and are constrained by) the resource cost for different
endeavours they can’t make the best decisions, neither can the best decisions
be arrived at scientifically because the extent of the public want cannot be
captured or quantified until they put a value on it and commit to paying that
cost.

However, TZM assert that no monetary system can be set up in such a way that
price would always be a rational measure of value (not subject to artificial
distortions), and therefore reject all forms of money and pricing. This
precludes the possibility that a money-based system could be invented and
advocated by TZM even if it could spark the transition to sustainable access
abundance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



3. Transition issues
--------------------

There are certain causality dilemmas brought up by an NLRBE: Building the
systems and physical infrastructure is tricky outside of en existing NLRBE;
and the global access-oriented abundance mindset that would be ubiquitous in
an NLRBE needs to be widespread before an NLRBE could be possible.

TZM’s educational initiatives attempt to address the second point, but
although many people *can* learn this mindset only some *do*. It takes a lot of
effort and an open mind to re-educate yourself this way and not everyone is
that way inclined. Many people will need to experience or at least see it
working in order to open up to it.

It is therefore clear that some kind of transition is required. TZM
acknowledges this, but steers clear of defining or advocating any specific
plans or actions in this area, dismissing the transition as a peripheral issue.
However, it is actually a core issue relating to what TZM advocates because
even if everyone is convinced, unless there are specific actions to take and
initiatives to investigate and experiment with, they will just go back to
business as usual. In order to effect maximum change, TZM needs to reconsider
the education-only approach and make ‘transition’ into a core issue.

TZM could define some transition system requirements, for example valid
transition systems should:

* allow us to build the infrastructure that creates access abundance, making
  NLRBE possible;
* be easy to understand with current mindsets whilst also encouraging a mindset
  shift;
* not require global adoption;
* be capable of organic growth so it can start off small and scale up;
* allow cooperation with existing systems (capitalist countries/businesses) in
  its infancy;
* demonstrate the real value and power of a participatory direct democracy to
  encourage change and eventual adoption by existing economies;
* maintain existing concepts of incentive while other forms can be tested and
  validated.
* have a natural tendency towards abundance;

This may not be a complete set of requirements, but one could be drafted such
that eventually the money aspect of any such system would become redundant.
An NLRBE (or something similar) would then come about as a natural consequence
of the system.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Conclusion
----------

TZM is not currently having the impact that it could have. Advocating an
unfalsifiable idea which is rejected by many people hinders the progress of the
movement. However, TZM could be an influential change-agent with the following
shifts in advocacy:

* maintain the educational initiatives;
* bring focus to transition issues, accepting that money will almost certainly
  be involved (at least at the economic border);
* advocate action-based proposals that will ease the transition;

Example of such action-based proposals:

* Testing other systems that would naturally tend towards NLRBE;
* Develop/test infrastructure vital to NLRBE;
* Permanently solve problems that would still be a problem in an NLRBE.
