What is wrong with what TZM currently advocates in 2014?
---

In the spirit of the TZM Challenge, this essay aims to highlight some problems with the current direction of TZM advocacy in order that TZM can alter their initiatives and have greater impact in achieving global sustainability for humanity.

In summary:

1. The approach used by TZM is not scientific.
2. The arguments against pricing fail to recognise its social and democratic value.
3. It is invalid to dismiss transition issues as “peripheral”.

I have devised an alternative economic system that I call a Contribution Driven Economy (CDE). I don’t have space to fully describe it here, but it will serve as an example of one possible alternative, to demonstrate that advocating an NLRBE is not the most effective way for TZM to create change at this time.

For this purpose you need to know that a CDE uses an energy-based currency with a universal basic income, a fully open and transparent accounting system, and everything is non-profit. It is an access (not ownership) oriented society that employs direct democracy via voluntary contributions to social projects.

The contribution system is similar to the Collaborative Design System proposed by TZM, but in addition to governing the socially-owned means of production it covers land-use, health-care, transport, public spaces, etc. in a single system. It also uses subjective human decisions influenced by objective pricing (without value-distortion) as a stop-gap until this can be more automated by a functional global resource management system and a robust working and tested implementation of the design efficiency equation. Traditional capitalist ‘incentive’ structures remain, but are kept in check by a negative feedback system built right into the economy, making a CDE easy to understand with the current global mindset.

This essay will not argue the case for a CDE, it is used only as an example of one possible alternative system to highlight some issues with current TZM advocacy.


1. An un-scientific approach
---

While TZM advocates a scientific approach to governing society based on natural laws, it is proposing a single solution which requires global uptake. This makes it untestable except by actually doing it. Empirical data to support their claim that an NLRBE is the best way to achieve global sustainability cannot be gathered in advance.

A more scientific approach would be to propose different alternatives to our current system, with some well-defined and measurable goals in mind. These alternatives should be testable, first by simulation using real human inputs, then on a small scale such as a city after feedback and refinement from the simulations. The alternative systems should be capable of organic growth (in terms of spreading across the globe) so that if a viable solution is discovered it can scale up slowly and any problems not discovered in the simulations can be addressed while still manageable.

This is not the only valid scientific approach, it is just an example.


2. Money and pricing
---

The arguments against money and pricing are based on their use and effects within the current global market, which is a closed/dishonest and profit-driven economy. They are valid in that context, but don’t consider how useful money and pricing could be in any alternative systems that turn price into a rational measure of subjective demand preferences balanced against availability determined by the design efficiency equation.

In a Contribution Driven Economy, money is given to people freely and they can spend it on themselves or contribute it to social projects for increased social status and influence. This provides a mechanism for obtaining public consensus about a wide range of issues, but not a consensus of pure wants - a consensus balanced and constrained by social cost (in terms of resources/energy). For example if you asked a community should we build a leisure centre or a theme park which also has all those leisure facilities - why not go for the theme park? So unless the public have a view of (and are constrained by) the resource/energy cost of the different proposals, they can’t make the best decisions.

Compared to designing and implementing the global resource management system and the design efficiency equation, and relying on them to work on a global scale, the system I propose in a CDE (based on pricing) is much much simpler and more easily achievable, and doesn’t have the drawbacks of money/pricing seen in capitalism. This means other possible systems could also do the same.

How does the design efficiency equation get a true understanding of how much humans value different things? What people say they value and what they really value when forced to decide are often completely different. To illustrate this, imagine for a moment all the wonderful things you’d get if you suddenly got two years salary. Chances are that you’d get some of these things, but others would turn out to be not as important as they are expensive. That is our perceived value for something changes between theoretically imagining its value and actually having to give something up for it.

3. Transition issues
---

advocating an unrealistic idea, where even if everyone suddenly agreed it wouldn’t be clear what to do next, or even if it was clear it wouldn’t be viable within existing systems. Therefore in deciding where to focus advocacy efforts TZM should advocate something that will naturally lead to RBE rather than directly advocating RBE itself.

time to build software systems and physical infrastructure, testing of such, scaling up of such, and refinement / incremental improvement of such.

Unless there are some proposals for possible transitions that can be started on, or investigated/experimented on, there is nothing to actually advocate. There needs to be some kind of ROI (effort vs benefit) calculation.

what we need as a transition is a system that creates abundance first - only then can we start to adopt something like an RBE

An RBE is only viable if it already exists:
a) The infrastructure required needs to be built - in an RBE no problem, but now, economics gets in the way.
b) The population needs an access-oriented abundance mindset instead of an ownership-oriented scarcity one. In an RBE everyone would have such a mindset, but at the moment we don't - many people can learn this through intellectual pursuits, yet many don’t because it’s a lot of effort, and many more need to experience or at least see it working in order to learn this mindset.

Therefore transition is a core issue for TZM advocacy not a peripheral one. We need a transition system that:
a) allows us to build the infrastructure that creates access abundance (RBE depends on it and maintains/improves it, but doesn’t create it in the first place).
b) is easy to understand with current mindsets but also encourages the global mindset to shift (by demonstration and experience), without needing to be a globally adopted system.
c) encourages and demonstrates the real value and power of a participatory direct democracy to help people realise how undemocratic our current democracies really are (even when they’re not abused and manipulated).
d) Maintains existing concepts of incentive while other forms of incentive as proposed in RBE can be validated, or possibly even invalidated?
