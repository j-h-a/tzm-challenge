What is wrong with what TZM currently advocates in 2014?
---

In the spirit of the TZM Challenge, this essay aims to highlight some problems with the current direction of TZM advocacy in order that TZM can alter their initiatives and have greater impact in achieving social and economic sustainability for humanity.

In summary:

1. The approach used by TZM is not scientific.
2. The arguments against pricing fail to recognise its social and democratic value.
3. It is invalid to dismiss transition issues as “peripheral”.
